**ResponseDetective** is a non-intrusive framework for intercepting any outgoing requests and incoming responses between your app and your server for debugging purposes.

## Requirements

ResponseDetective is written in **Swift 3.2** and supports **iOS 8.0+**, **macOS 10.9+** and **tvOS 9.0+**.

## Usage

Incorporating ResponseDetective in your project is very simple â€“ it all comes down to just two steps:

### Step 1: Enable interception

For ResponseDetective to work, it needs to be added as a middleman between your `(NS)URLSession` and the Internet. You can do this by registering the provided `URLProtocol` class in your session's `(NS)URLSessionConfiguration.protocolClasses`, or use a shortcut method:

```objc
// Objective-C

NSURLSessionConfiguration *configuration = [NSURLSessionConfiguration defaultSessionConfiguration];
[RDTResponseDetective enableInConfiguration:configuration];
```

```swift
// Swift

let configuration = URLSessionConfiguration.default
ResponseDetective.enable(inConfiguration: configuration)
```

Then, you should use that configuration with your `(NS)URLSession`:

```objc
// Objective-C

NSURLSession *session = [[NSURLSession alloc] initWithConfiguration:configuration];
```

```swift
// Swift

let session = URLSession(configuration: configuration)
```

Or, if you're using [AFNetworking](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking)/[Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) as your networking framework, integrating ResponseDetective comes down to just initializing your `AFURLSessionManager`/`Manager` with the above `(NS)URLSessionConfiguration`:

```objc
// Objective-C (AFNetworking)

AFURLSessionManager *manager = [[AFURLSessionManager alloc] initWithSessionConfiguration:configuration];
```

```swift
// Swift (Alamofire)

let manager = Alamofire.SessionManager(configuration: configuration)
```

And that's all!

### Step 2: Profit

Now it's time to perform the actual request:

```objc
// Objective-C

NSURLRequest *request = [[NSURLRequest alloc] initWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"http://httpbin.org/get"]];
[[session dataTaskWithRequest:request] resume];
```

```swift
// Swift

let request = URLRequest(URL: URL(string: "http://httpbin.org/get")!)
session.dataTask(with: request).resume()
```

VoilÃ ! ðŸŽ‰ Check out your console output:

```none
<0x000000000badf00d> [REQUEST] GET https://httpbin.org/get
 â”œâ”€ Headers
 â”œâ”€ Body
 â”‚ <none>

 â”‚     "Host" : "httpbin.org",
 â”‚     "Accept-Language" : "en-us",
 â”‚     "Accept" : "*\/*"
 â”‚   },
 â”‚   "url" : "https:\/\/httpbin.org\/get"
 â”‚ }
```
